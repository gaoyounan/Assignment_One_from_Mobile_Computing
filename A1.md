  - **explain what the buy-in for the user is (why would someone use it?):**<br/>
  Tinder gives both natives and tourists a simple way to make new friends for all kinds of purposes such as for one night stay, for the escort service etc. The Tinder limits the ordinary users the maximum times to like the others per day. Only the paid users could get extra chances to like more people.

  - **identify what combination of technologies are leveraged:**<br/>
  This is just an simple App. The most important technology adapted in this App is location based service, which allowed the users to limit the location scope to find friends. As usual, people would like to make online friends nearby, because that will be easy to make a date in the future. Another important technology is networking. The pictures you skims through Tinder are gone unless two persons like with each other. There is no chance for each user to like the same person twice. This is a popular function called "Burn after reading" originated from SnapChat. The last not the least, there is a smart strategy adapted in this app, which is bonded with the giant Facebook and Instagram. Only the pictures uploaded to the Facebook and Instagram could be used in Tinder. In this way, users in Tinder could not upload the other people’s portrait.

  - **identify the type of the application:**<br/>
 This is kind of an App combining Social Network and Instant Messaging properties.

  - **describe the applications strengths and weaknesses, and suggest any improvement that you would make.**<br/>
  In recently years，Tinder provides a new function called “Super like”，which could make the user who received the “super like” notices you when he or she is checking your profile even before this user makes the decision whether like you or not. That is really amazing function which could show the level of your favor.

  - **First Heuristic Evaluation:** [*Aesthetic and minimalist design*][2]

    The views in Tinder is simple. One big portrait occupies most part of the screen with three buttons at the bottom which are “like”, “dislike”, and “super like”. The style simple but clear. There is no any irrelevant information or rarely needed function on the main view.<br/>

  - **Second Heuristic Evaluation:** [*Consistency and standards*][2]

    In fact, you will find few literature when you play with Tinder. Only two fatal information exists in the main view, which are the names of the online persons and distance away from the user. For the three button, Tinder are using clear sign to indicate their function such as with cross mark Indicating dislike, with heart mark as like, with blue start as super like. The users would not get confused among these three buttons.<br/>


**Second Application: [Casion Taxi]**<br/>
**Link to application:** [<u>https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/casino-taxi/id628069338?mt=8</u>]

  - **describe the application:**<br/>
  Casino taxi is an App to order a taxi cab online. It is easy and helpful. With this App, people do not need to
  wait for a taxi in the cold winter.

  - **explain why this application was chosen:**<br/>
  In Halifax, thers is no Uber service, no Didi service(Taxi Booking App in China). Instead, they have Casino taxi.
  In fact, the function of this App is similar to the App Uber but more simple than Uber.
  There is no way on Casion Taxi to check the driver's information before you book a certain taxi as Uber does.
  However, you can find some Heuritics in this App worth to learn.

  - **explain what the buy-in for the user is (why would someone use it?):**<br/>
  As it is mentioned before, with Casino Taxi. Peopel do not need to wait for the taxi on the cold street.
  They can check the cabs around themselves in real time, book a cab in advance and wait for them at home.
  Once the destination is fixed, this App could give an estimated cost for your trip.
  It gives four kinds of cabs for clients to choose.
  Even the people on the wheelchair could access the service this App provides.

  - **identify what combination of technologies are leveraged:**<br/>
  The mainly two functions this App is using are networking and GPS.

  - **identify the type of the application:**<br/>
 This is kind of an O2O(Object to Object) App and providing location based service.

  - **describe the applications strengths and weaknesses, and suggest any improvement that you would make.**<br/>
  This App could keep the history reservations over the past 30 days, which is convenient for the clients.
  But the clients could not get the driver profile before booking the cab.
  As Uber does, the driver profile including the history comments from the other clients
  are useful for the clients to judge whether or not to take the service from the drivers that this App aranges.

    And the guidebook is simple with 5 pages. For each page, it includes a picture to show how to use the certain function.
    Furthermore, the words in the guidebook are familiar with the users.
